Python FastAPI Backend with Secure Authentication and Profile Services
This repository contains a production-ready Python backend built using FastAPI. It includes essential security measures for authentication, protected routes, user registration, login, and fetching profile information services.

Features
User Registration: New users can sign up with a unique username and a strong password.
User Login: Registered users can securely log in using their credentials.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication.
Protected Routes: Certain routes are protected and require a valid JWT token to access.
Profile Information: Authenticated users can fetch their profile information.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repo.git
cd your-backend-repo
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project directory and add the following:

dotenv
Copy code
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./test.db
Replace your_secret_key_here with a strong secret key.

Initialize the database:

bash
Copy code
alembic upgrade head
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The development server will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Endpoints
POST /signup: Register a new user by providing a username and password.

POST /login: Log in with a username and password to receive a JWT token.

GET /profile: Fetch the profile information of the currently logged-in user.

Security Measures
Passwords are securely hashed before storage using a strong hashing algorithm.
JWT tokens are generated upon successful login and required for accessing protected routes.
API endpoints are protected against common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Environment variables are used to store sensitive information like secret keys and database URLs.
Passwords are not stored in plaintext; only their hashes are stored in the database.
The database is initialized using Alembic migrations for easy version control.
Deployment
This backend can be deployed to various platforms like AWS, Heroku, or your preferred cloud service provider. Ensure to set up environment variables in your production environment for security.
;) Happy Hacking
